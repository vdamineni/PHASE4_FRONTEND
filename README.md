## Phase IV FRONT END Repository

The application was developed using React, a free and open-source JavaScript library designed to simplify the creation of component-based user interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience. The backend was built using Node.js for server-side logic and MySQL for database management, with stored procedures implemented to efficiently handle database operations and maintain data integrity. Additionally, the front end effectively processes and displays errors originating from the backend, including those generated by the MySQL server, ensuring clear communication of any issues to the user.

## Set up Instructions
- Clone both the front end and back end repositories (https://github.com/vdamineni/PHASE4_BACKEND)
- Open MySQL and run the stored procedure file and the schema file
- run `node server.js` to start the backend server

- open another cmd tab
- change directory to PHASE4_FRONTEND
- run `npm start` to run the app
