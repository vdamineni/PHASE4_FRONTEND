## Phase IV FRONT END Repository

The front end of the application was developed using React, a free and open-source JavaScript library designed to simplify the creation of component-based user interfaces. It seamlessly integrates with the backend to enhance user experience. Additionally, the front end efficiently handles errors originating from the backend, including those generated by the MySQL server, ensuring that any issues are appropriately communicated to the user.
